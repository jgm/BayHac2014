Here is some Haskell:

``` {.haskell .numberLines}
runDfa :: (Eq a) => DirectDfa a -> [a] -> Bool
runDfa (DirectState final trans) []
  = final
runDfa (DirectState final trans) (x:xs)
  = case [ s | (x',s) <- trans, x == x' ] of
        []    -> False
        (s:_) -> runDfa s xs
```

And inline: `fmap (++ "foo")`{.haskell}.
